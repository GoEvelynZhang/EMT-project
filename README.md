### Introduction
This projects aims to research the investment opportunity in Intel Corporation, and takes both the qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis approach to value the stock price of Intel.

For qualitative analysis of Intel stock price, we take a deep dive into the business operation of Intel, starting from disecting its business, its market position, its competitors and its internal strengths as well as weakness, including an evaluation of its strategy and potential risks in business.

For quantitative analysis, we apply both a two-stage FCFF model and a relative valuation approach, selecting PEG (1 year estimation, analyst consensus) as the dependent variable.
