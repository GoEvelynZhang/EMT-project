### Introduction
This projects aims to research the investment opportunity in Intel Corporation, and takes both the qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis approach to value the stock price of Intel.

For qualitative analysis of Intel stock price, we take a deep dive into the business operation of Intel, starting from disecting its business, its market position, its competitors and its internal strengths as well as weakness, including an evaluation of its strategy and potential risks in business.

For quantitative analysis, we apply both a two-stage FCFF model and a relative valuation approach, selecting PEG (1 year estimation, analyst consensus) as the dependent variable.

### Key Takeaways

* Researcher’s suggestion: while the semiconductor sector shows strong sign of sinking in the third quarter 2018 due to disappointing earnings, Intel beats analysts’ expectation again with its third quarter earnings of 19.2 Billion, 19.3% up from 2017. Also, with peer companies such as Nvidia and AMD trading at 30 P/E, Intel has been trading around 14. So this is a strong buy.
* Revenue beat expectation again while semiconductor industry going down: Semiconductor industry get struck in the third and fourth quarter 2018 due to saturated PC markets, trade war, failure in meeting investors’ expectations. However, Intel shows strong revenue growth in its 3Q report. This is due to its less tying with the chip-making industry and strong leader position in data-booming era
* Data center Group keeps growing at two digit speed and is expected to keep the momentum: Contrary to analysts’ expectation of a slower growth in its Data center group. The third quarter financial report shows 6.1 billion revenue in DCG, 26% up from last year. Besides, new introduction of Intel Xeon Scalable are expected to be new revenue drivers for Intel.
* PC sector profit remains strong and Intel grabbing profit from gaming booms: Even with the PC demand shrinking as a whole, Intel’s PC centric Group gained 27.1 Billion revenue in the first three quarters in 2018, up 8.2% from 2017. This is partly due to the new introduction of 8th Gen Intel® CoreTM processors and Intel Core i9-9900K processor, which can be only quarterly driver for revenue. However, deeper integration in the gaming sector recently enables Intel to grab the demand from this gaming sector.
* Strong growth potential from AI chips as Intel approaching independent GPU eventually: After three years of platform establishing through series of acquisition, Intel reveals its ambition and shows clearer path of its development in AI chip sector. With declaration of joining the GPU competition, Intel has for now touched all kinds of possible future trend for AI chips: CPU,GPU,FPGA,ASIC. It’s corporation witn AMD in GPU would give them competitive strength in face of Nvidia’s dominance in GPU market.

### Industry Overview
The key demand of customers for semiconductor industry product, if can be concluded by three words, are smaller, faster, and cheaper. That reveals that the semiconductor industry is highly demand-side business. Usually the targeted customers for semiconductor companies are enterprise customers and retailer customers.
By 2017, Semiconductor industry grow to a market with $412 billion revenue generated, with average 13% growth annually. However, this industry bears cyclical and volatile features, as it swings with the demand side development and depreciation. Also, the Semiconductor industry is extremely competitive, as it is a fast-growing, technology-dependent, demand-driven industry. Even the large ones such as IBM in old times can be beaten by incorrect market decision or one time lagging in technology improvement. That’s why many players in this industry have set up its own ecosystem by partnering with their major customers and building exclusive products. Due to the competitive and volatile nature of this industry, it is currently a typical oligopoly market with just a few giants competing against each other.

### Company description
Founded in 1968, Intel is now the world second largest semiconductor producer by revenue. Intel offers products ranging from CPUs, memory chips for PCs, to server scalable, and memory chips for server clusters, to modems for phones, to AI chips for self-driving cars. It is the major supplier for the computer manufacturers such as Apple, HP, Lenovo. Intel is headquartered in Santa Clara, California and has a little over 100,000 employees worldwide until November 2018. The companies’ revenue are currently broken into 5 parts, with two parts being the major revenue and profit source. They are: (1) Client Computing Group (CCG), which targets PCs and Notebooks and composes 52.1% of the company’s revenue in the 12 month training. (2) Data Center Group (DCG), which targets servers with processors and memory chips and composes 32.2% of the company’s revenue in the 12 month training. The company’s three other segments include: (3) Programmable Solutions Group (PSG); (4) Non-Volatile Memory Solution Group (NSG) ; (5) Internet of Things Group (IOTG)
### Competitor analysis
* Rivalry is medium to high
* Threat of substitute is low
* Threat of new Entry is low
* Demand side bargaining power is medium
* Supply side bargaining power is low

### Investment Thesis
* Expecting revenue from Client Computing to maintain single digit, steady growth
* Expecting double-digit revenue growth in Data Center Group in 2019
* Internet and Things: Cloud computing centering, with hardware designed for supporting
* Deeper integration into AI market could be Intel’s next growth driver
* Opportunities from the GPU market as Intel plans to supply Discrete GPU in 2020

### Business Strategy Assessment
* “Industrial-wide layout is Intel’s ambitious business strategy and brings industrial reliance”
* “Cost management & one technology two markets strategy”

### Risk Analysis
* “Monopolistic pricing power might be squeezed in the Data Center Group as more competitions coming up”
* “Quantity beats Quality”
* “We don’t need such powerful chips: threat of disruptive technology”
* “Brand value dilemma: Intel can only be on the high-end and leader”
* “More Companies are outsourcing for production to manage cost, but not Intel”
* “With large money invested, products like 3D Xpoint is still losing money”

### Valuation
1. DCF approach
As being a tech-intense, premium pricing company, the biggest drivers for Intel’s value are its operating margin and the sustainability of its ROC, which can be measured by the years of its high growth. To see how the value of Intel stock can varies from my assumption about these two factors, I performed a sensitivity analysis on its stock price.

From it, I find that the stock price is most sensitive to my assumption of the operating margin. Looking into history, Intel has never had an operating margin below 29%. Also, we even find trend for operating margin going up from 2016. This is due to Intel’s cost management in its rising mature data center group business. And I expect this cost reduction to continue as the management gets more sophisticated and this business gains more scale. That is to say, it’s rare to see Intel’s operating margin jump down that much in recent years.

2. Relative Valuation
On the P/E basis, over the last 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years INTC has traded at an average of 16.1X,15.9X, 15.3X respectively, its current multiple of 15.34. For the EV/EBIT basis over the last 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, INTC has traded at an average of 9.6X, 9.8X, 10.2X, its current multiple of 9.62.

When comparing INTC versus other mega-cap tech hardware companies, I believe that the company is currently trading under its peers.

Given Intel’s low double-digit revenue growth and increasing profit margin, I believe Intel should be traded in parallel to its semiconductor peers. INTC is currently trading at 14.76X P/E while its peers are trading at an industry average of 30.1X. Looking at P/E ratio of Intel and Cisco, which is has similar capitalization, Cisco is trading at 15.9X P/E ratio while Intel is only at 14.76X. This doesn’t seem to make sense Cisco is growing much slower and bears more volatility on the market swings (one year Beta being 1.21 compared to Intel’s 1.03). Rationally it make sense to assign a higher price for companies who has higher growth and fewer risk. So I think Intel is undervalued by the market. One reason for this undervaluation can be market’s concern about the growth sustainability about Intel. Yet as I believe, the momentum in term of revenue driver and cost cut is still substantial as business is diversifying risk and introducing market-catering products.
#### regression relative valuation
I handpicked 17 comparable firms based on their most similarity with Intel’s business. Particularly, I added in Intel’s biggest competitors such as Nvidia and Qualcomm.

Since Intel is in the high-tech semiconductor industry, growth is considered the major driver for market’s pricing of the stock. So we choose the PEG multiple.

When we primarily regress PEG on all three regressor, the payout ratio shows extremely insignificance (p value >0.1). When checking the distribution of payout ratio in this sample, I find polarizing features about the payout ratio -- they either not paying or paying out a lot. Then I argue this is because the different stage those companies are at. Mature companies pay out a lot while new companies tend to reinvest everything. And the market does not care much about the payout ratio since growth is valued more in the high-tech industry. So when we drop payout ratio and regress, we get:

PEG = 3.081783-1.38098 * g(EPS) -1.238558 * Beta

Based on this regression and Intel’s g(EPS) = 14.2% & Beta = 1.09, Intel’s predicted PEG is 1.536 > actual PEG (1.1),
 suggesting Intel undervalued by 28.4%.
